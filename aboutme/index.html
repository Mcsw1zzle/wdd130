    <h2>Parker McBride</h2>
    <h2>PTcruiser, or Spidey</h2>
    <p>My full name is Parker Thomas McBride, Thomas being my fathers first name. 
    I turn 21 this month and I am very excited for that. This my first semester
    at BYUI as I am a transfer student from Salt Lake Community College. I am 
    currently working towards my associates of technologies, and from there I 
    will be going for my bachelors in Computer Sciences.</p>
    <p>I am currently engaged to the absolute love of my life and we have been
    together for over a year and a half. I have been a member of the Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. I recently just had a pet
    pass away, I had him for 13 years, his name was Rocky and he was a New
    Foundland. I now have an adorble Netherlands Dwarf bunny named Buddy that
    I adore. Currently I work as a carpenter but my long-term career plan is 
    to get into software development and game design.</p>
