      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <h6>The Inspiration </h6>
      <p>
        This inspiration for starting this website was one that 
        I attribute to my education as a young adult. I am currently 
        taking a class in web development and design for college, in 
        order to further my education in the field of coding. Our 
        final assignment for the semester would lead to the creation 
        of this website and all of its content. Little did I know that 
        an assignment spanning the course of a couple of months would 
        be so impactful on me and my education, as well as my 
        confidence as a coder and designer. I hope that one day I can 
        go on to create many mighty and beautiful, fully functioning 
        websites.
      </p>
      <h6>The Plan</h6>
      <p>
        This idea for this website came to me when I had a difficult 
        time, about a year ago, coming up with my own logo for a 
        project I had been working on regarding starting a small 
        company. I am sure there are plenty of people out there just 
        like me, who have a difficult time being creative, and could 
        use some help from now and again. That is why I created a plan 
        to design and code a website that could accommodate the less 
        creative by giving them logo inspiration. 
      </p>
      <h6>The Mission</h6>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the above paragraph, this website allows 
        you to pick from a wide variety of logo templates/premade 
        logos for your business. Once you have selected one that you 
        like, you will be able to then pick out merchandise that you 
        can apply that logo to. This opens up a great opportunity to 
        take the first steps of marketing and advertising your 
        business to a larger audience than you might currently be 
        dealing with. This website aims to please, by taking some 
        stress off of your plate, and getting you started on the 
        right path to being a successful business owner.
