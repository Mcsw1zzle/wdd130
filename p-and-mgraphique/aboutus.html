            <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                This inspiration for starting this website was one 
                that I attribute to my education as a young adult. 
                I am currently taking a class in web development and 
                design for college, in order to further my education 
                in the field of coding. Our final assignment for the 
                semester would lead to the creation of this website 
                and all of its content. Little did I know that an 
                assignment spanning the course of a couple of months 
                would be so impactful on me and my education, as well 
                as my confidence as a coder and designer. I hope that 
                one day I can go on to create many mighty and beautiful, 
                fully functioning websites.
            </p>
            <h2>The Plan</h2>
            <p>
                This idea for this website came to me when I had a 
                difficult time, about a year ago, coming up with my 
                own logo for a project I had been working on regarding 
                starting a small company. I am sure there are plenty of 
                people out there just like me, who have a difficult 
                time being creative, and could use some help from now 
                and again. That is why I created a plan to design and 
                code a website that could accommodate the less creative 
                by giving them logo inspiration.
            </p>
            <h2>The Mission</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned in the above paragraph, this website allows 
                you to pick from a wide variety of logo templates/premade 
                logos for your business. Once you have selected one that 
                you like, you will be able to then pick out merchandise 
                that you can apply that logo to. This opens up a great 
                opportunity to take the first steps of marketing and 
                advertising your business to a larger audience than you 
                might currently be dealing with. This website aims to 
                please, by taking some stress off of your plate, and 
                getting you started on the right path to being a 
                successful business owner.
